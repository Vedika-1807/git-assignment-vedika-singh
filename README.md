# GitHub & Git Assignment 
## What I Learned from the video

git add: Moves specific changes to the "staging area" effectively marking them as ready to be saved.

git commit: Creates a permanent snapshot of your staged changes in your local history with descriptive message.

Branching: Creates a separate, safe copy of your code to test new features without affecting the main project.
